### Additional Notes üìù
- The app uses **cookies** to store user settings and preferences, such as chosen competitors.
- The project includes comprehensive **ESLint** configurations to ensure code quality and consistency.
- The **theme provider** (`ThemeProvider.tsx`) allows switching between light and dark modes and saves the user's preference in `localStorage`.
